# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project is as follows:

- To randomly generate 2,000 latitudes and longitudes across the world, to match these coordinates with nearby cities across the world using CitiPy, and to generate a .CSV file inclusive of weather information for each of these cities (see the Weather_Database folder for additional details);

- To use the weather information and cities obtained above in order to locate hotels near these cities that fall within desired weather/temperature parameters as specified by the end-user (see the Vacation_Search folder for more information);

- To plot a route through three desired desitnations using the hotel data obtained above and to maps this route via Google Maps (see Vacation_Intinerary folder for more information).
